## Manual Testing Checklist

### Color Contrast Testing
1. **Tools Required**:
   - Browser DevTools
   - WebAIM Contrast Checker (https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)
   - axe DevTools browser extension

2. **Test Each Component**:
   - [ ] Primary button text on orange background
   - [ ] Form input placeholders
   - [ ] Success/error messages
   - [ ] Link colors on glass backgrounds
   - [ ] Icon colors in forms

### Keyboard Navigation Testing
1. **Authentication Modal**:
   - [ ] Tab through all form fields in correct order
   - [ ] Password visibility toggle accessible via keyboard
   - [ ] Submit button accessible and activates with Enter/Space
   - [ ] Modal can be closed with Escape key
   - [ ] Focus returns to trigger element when modal closes

2. **Form Validation**:
   - [ ] Error messages announced by screen readers
   - [ ] Focus moves to first error field
   - [ ] Error state clearly visible with high contrast

### Screen Reader Testing
Test with at least one of: NVDA (Windows), JAWS (Windows), or VoiceOver (macOS)

1. **Form Labels and Descriptions**:
   - [ ] All form fields have proper labels
   - [ ] Placeholder text is announced
   - [ ] Required fields are indicated
   - [ ] Error messages are associated with fields

2. **Interactive Elements**:
   - [ ] Buttons have descriptive labels
   - [ ] Links have meaningful text
   - [ ] Modal dialogs are properly announced

### High Contrast Mode Testing
1. **Windows High Contrast**:
   - Enable: Settings > Ease of Access > High Contrast
   - [ ] All text remains readable
   - [ ] Borders are visible
   - [ ] Interactive elements are distinguishable

2. **Browser Zoom Testing**:
   - [ ] Test at 200% zoom without horizontal scroll
   - [ ] All interactive elements remain usable
   - [ ] Text doesn't overlap or become unreadable

### Mobile Accessibility Testing
1. **Touch Target Size**:
   - [ ] All buttons meet 44px minimum size
   - [ ] Adequate spacing between interactive elements
   - [ ] Form fields easy to tap accurately

2. **Responsive Design**:
   - [ ] Glass morphism effects work on mobile
   - [ ] Text remains readable on small screens
   - [ ] Modal dialogs are usable on mobile

## Automated Testing Commands

### Run Accessibility Tests
```bash
# Install testing dependencies (if not already installed)
pnpm add -D @axe-core/playwright axe-core

# Run accessibility tests
pnpm run test:a11y

# Generate accessibility report
pnpm run a11y:report
```

### Browser Extension Testing
1. **axe DevTools**:
   - Install browser extension
   - Open authentication modal
   - Run axe scan
   - Verify no critical issues remain

2. **WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool)**:
   - Install browser extension
   - Navigate to authentication flows
   - Check for contrast errors
   - Verify all issues are resolved

## Expected Test Results

### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance Status
After implementing these changes, expect:
- **Overall Compliance**: 100% (11 of 11 color combinations pass)
- **Critical Issues**: 0 remaining
- **Contrast Ratios**: All meet or exceed 4.5:1 for normal text

### Specific Measurements
- Primary text on glass: **16.79:1** (AAA level)
- Secondary text on glass: **8.27:1** (AAA level)
- Orange links: **4.52:1** (AA level)
- Form placeholders: **4.51:1** (AA level)
- Success messages: **5.01:1** (AA+ level)
- Error messages: **5.15:1** (AA+ level)

## Continuous Monitoring

### Pre-commit Hooks
Add accessibility testing to your development workflow:

```json
{
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-commit": "pnpm run lint && pnpm run test:a11y"
    }
  }
}
```

### CI/CD Integration
Include accessibility tests in your build pipeline:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/accessibility.yml
name: Accessibility Tests
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  accessibility:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run Accessibility Tests
        run: |
          pnpm install
          pnpm run test:a11y
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Glass Morphism Not Working
- Check browser support for `backdrop-filter`
- Verify CSS classes are applied correctly
- Ensure parent elements don't have `overflow: hidden`

### Contrast Issues Persist
- Clear browser cache and reload
- Verify CSS variables are properly imported
- Check for CSS specificity conflicts

### Screen Reader Problems
- Ensure proper semantic HTML structure
- Verify ARIA labels are present and correct
- Test with multiple screen reader/browser combinations

## Documentation and Training

### Team Resources
- Share this testing guide with all developers
- Include accessibility checks in code review process
- Provide training on WCAG guidelines

### User Documentation
- Create user guide for accessibility features
- Document keyboard shortcuts
- Provide alternative access methods

## Reporting Issues

If accessibility issues are discovered:
1. Document the specific WCAG guideline violated
2. Include steps to reproduce
3. Provide suggested remediation
4. Test fix with real users when possible

Remember: Accessibility is an ongoing process, not a one-time fix. Regular testing and user feedback are essential for maintaining an inclusive experience.
